    "# Creating and Managing Sibling Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most valuable features of DataLad is the ability to create and manage multiple instances of a dataset.\n",
    "These so-called siblings are linked copies that can communicate changes just like git repositories.\n",
    "Whether you want to back up your dataset locally, transfer it to an HPC for analysis or publish it on an open science platform - DataLad's siblings provide a convenient way of doing it without having to worry about the underlying file system operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Create a sibling on an open science platform (you can choose between GIN and OSF) \n",
    "  2. Create a sibling locally, in a separate folder or external drive.\n",
    "  3. Create a sibling on GitHub and link it to the data on the open science platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create siblings, we first need a dataset. The cell below creates a new dataset with the `-c yoda` option which configures the dataset according to the [YODA principles](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-127-yoda.html), a set of practices for data analysis in DataLad datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    ">  1. One thing, one dataset.\n",
    ">  2. Record where you got it from, and where it is now.\n",
    ">  3. Record what you did to it, and with what.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, it is enough that this configuration option automatically creates some folders and files (e.g., `README.md` and `code/README.md`) so we can create siblings and exchange data without having to add content ourselves. Just run the cell below to create a YODA dataset in the `my-data` directory."

    "## Using Open Science Repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several open science repositories that can host your dataset for free.\n",
    "Some, like [OpenNeuro](openneuro.org) and [DANDI](https://about.dandiarchive.org/), require standardized data formats while others accept any kind of data.\n",
    "In this section we will use repositories of the latter kind: [OSF](osf.io) and [GIN](https://gin.g-node.org/).\n",
    "DataLad provides ready-made functions to export your data to these repositories: `create-sibling-gin` and `create-sibling-osf` (requires the `datalad-osf` extension).\n",
    "Once these siblings are created you can push and clone just like you would with a regular git repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `create-sibling` commands require that DataLad can authenticate itself to create new repositories in your name.\n",
    "There are two main ways of authentication: SSH keys and access tokens.\n",
    "SSH keys are cryptographic key pairs (public and private) used for secure authentication to servers without passwords, while access tokens are temporary credentials (like passwords). \n",
    "GIN only supports SSH keys while OSF only supports access tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercises, you are going to create siblings for your dataset on GIN and OSF.\n",
