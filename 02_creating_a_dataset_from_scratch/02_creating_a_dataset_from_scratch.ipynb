    "## Modifying Content and Tracking Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "While DataLad wraps many functions of Git, there are some instances where we need to use `git` directly.\n",
    "Viewing the `git log` is one of those instances.\n",
    "This log is a critical part of any Git repository and DataLad dataset because it contains a comprehensive history of our dataset and every time we run `datalad save`, a new entry is created.\n",
    "Each commit has a unique hash and contains the commit's author and their email as well as the commit message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because DataLad wants to make sure that we don't accidentally overwrite our files once they are committed, it locks them to make them unmodifiable.\n",
    "This is why we have to use `datalad unlock` before we can modify them.\n",
    "When we run `datalad save` to save our changes, the file will be locked again.\n",
    "Even though DataLad reports unlocking as a file modification, it will only create a new entry in the commit history if the file actually changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note for Windows**: The Windows file system does not support file locking in the same way that Linux/macOS does. Instead, Windows duplicates the data and keeps one copy in the working directory and one backup copy for safety in the `.git` folder. This has the advantage that you don't need to unlock files before modifying them, but it also makes your dataset twice as big!\n",
    "Another consequence is that DataLad is creating a separate commit for this adjustment, so the most recent entry in your `git log` will always show the message *\"git-annex adjusted branch\"*. This means that, to get the most recent commit you made to the dataset, you have to look at the second-to-last entry in `git log`.\n",

We can tell DataLad which files should be annexed by editing the `.gitattributes` file. Let's look at the default `.gitattributes` that was created when we initialized the dataset:"
